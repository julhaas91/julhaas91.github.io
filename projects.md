I developed several RAG use cases and agent-based retrieval systems for clients like RTL, Bayernwerk.
RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation, where company specific information is retrieved (R) from databases and added as context (augmented / A) into the input of the LLM. The answer is then generated using the provided context (G) (see more on "What is a RAG?" TODO: write Blog article) RAG reduces the quality of the answers and ensures domain-specific responses that are aligned with your proprietary company information.

I led the implementation of such solutions for clients like RTL, Bayernwerke, Spiegel (TODO: restliche RAG Kunden hinzufügen), both on a proof-of-concept and production level. In these projects, I connected different data sources, such as text files (unstructured, semi-structured), PDF files, image files. 

TODO: RAG Chatbot Beispiele einfügen.
