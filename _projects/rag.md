## summary

I designed and implemented several proof-of-concepts (PoCs) using advanced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/retrieval-augmented-generation?hl=en">retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</a> and <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/why-agents-are-the-next-frontier-of-generative-ai">agent-based</a> approaches. 

These solutions enhanced the secure and compliant retrieval of sensitive company data by integrating internal and external data sources into vector databases. A functionality-focused chatbot frontend empowered service teams to work more efficiently.

### project goals

- Provide seamless access to unstructured company data, ensuring critical knowledge is preserved and easily retrievable.  
- Empower service teams with an intelligent chatbot capable of understanding and leveraging company data effectively.  
- Improve information retrieval accuracy using **semantic** and **hybrid** search techniques.  
- Implement **agent-based RAG** (retrieval-augmented generation) to handle complex queries and enable asynchronous action triggering.  
- Integrate external data sources to deliver comprehensive and context-rich information.  
- Address challenges such as knowledge loss due to reliance on experienced employees and uncover hidden insights buried deep within systems like Confluence or other repositories.

### key achievements

- Designed and implemented **semantic** and **hybrid** search approaches for multiple clients across various industries, including **agent-based RAG** (retrieval-augmented generation) solutions to handle complex, multi-step queries, and asynchronous action triggering.  
- Integrated external data sources to significantly enhance information retrieval capabilities.  
- Deployed chatbot user interfaces to enable access and enhance the service team efficiency.  
- Utilized techniques such as advanced [prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering), [guardrails](https://towardsdatascience.com/safeguarding-llms-with-guardrails-4f5d9f57cff2), [reranking](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/enhancing-rag-pipelines-with-re-ranking/), and [rerating](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/side-by-side-eval).  


### business impact

- Supported better decision-making by enabling comprehensive and efficient information retrieval (**increased search accuracy by over 50%**).  
- Improved query accuracy and reduced response time for complex queries through **agent-based architectures**.  
- Increased customer satisfaction by providing more accurate and contextual responses.  
- Optimized operational efficiency by enabling service teams with **chatbots**.


### technical highlights

- Utilized vector databases for efficient semantic search and data storage.
- Implemented RAG frameworks with [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) to combine retrieval and generation capabilities.
- Developed agent-based systems for dynamic planning and execution of complex queries.
- Integrated external APIs and databases for comprehensive data access.
- Applied advanced optimization strategies for data preparation, retrieval enhancement, and query processing.
