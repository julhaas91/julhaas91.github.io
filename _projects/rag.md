## summary

Developed and implemented advanced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/retrieval-augmented-generation?hl=en">retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</a> and <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/why-agents-are-the-next-frontier-of-generative-ai">agent-based</a> proof-of-concepts (PoCs) for various industry clients, incorporating cutting-edge techniques to enhance information retrieval and service quality. Connected external data sources with company data to vector databases, and deployed chatbots for service personnel.

### goals

- Enhance information retrieval accuracy using **semantic and hybrid search**
- Implement **agent-based RAG** for complex query handling
- Integrate external data sources for comprehensive information access
- Improve service quality through AI-powered chatbots for service personnel
