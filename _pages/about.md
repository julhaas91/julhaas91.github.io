Welcome! I'm a Google Cloud expert specializing in data-driven solutions, generative AI, machine learning and computer vision.

In just 2 years and 8 months, I advanced from junior to mid-level and senior roles, eventually becoming *Head of Machine Learning & GenAI - Google Cloud*  at a leading German consultancy with over €1.2 billion in revenue and more than 11,000 employees, where I led the strategic alignment of the [Google Cloud Competence Center](https://www.adesso.de/en/technologies/google/adesso-and-google-cloud.jsp) for the domains of machine learning, generative AI, and data. 

As a technical lead on multiple [projects](/_projects/) with budgets of €350k and more, I oversaw and coached software, data, and machine learning engineers, designing and implementing production-level AI solutions across various industries (e.g. banking, insurance, lottery, publishers, energy markets).

Now, I work as a Google Cloud, AI, data, and machine learning expert, specializing in solutions at the intersection of computer vision, robotics, manufacturing, and logistics. My focus is on developing AI systems that drive automation and efficiency.

Exemplary client recommendations (see all recommendations [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jh91/details/recommendations/)):<br><br>
_"Julius led the development of our cloud-native data platform for real-time algorithmic trading in energy markets. Starting from scratch, he and his team launched a production-ready MVP in under a year. The platform integrates diverse data sources (REST, SOAP, WebSocket, FTP, AWS SNS), scales automatically for high workloads, and allows seamless expansion to new sources and users across business areas.
The platform supports 10 trading experts daily. Going forward, algorithms on a Machine Learning platform will provide trading signals based on the data within the platform.
Julius's expertise in Google Cloud, particularly in Cloud Architecture, Machine Learning, and Data Engineering, combined with his excellent communication skills, makes him an invaluable asset to any project. His ability to understand complex requirements, translate them into business terms, and deliver effective solutions makes it a pleasure to collaborate with him.
I strongly recommend working with Julius."_ <br>([Lukas Stein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukas-stein/), Product Owner @ [badenova AG & Co. KG](https://www.badenova.de/))
